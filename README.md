Various notes not to forget to do things in the future  

1 - Start a repo about graph knowledge base based on socials links saved (e.g. IG, FB, linkedin, whatsapp, telegram)
and call it nosce-te-ipsum. <The goal is to reveal semantic recurring themes, to adderess career changes or recommendations on books etc.

2 - Start a new repo about the cybernetics book:  
- chapter 1 - the framework - commonalities, generalities, taxonomies, loops, recursions and similar  
- chapter 2 - biological codes, protein folding and the energy-entropy-information framework  
- chapter 3 - the brain - energetics, information, entropy  
- chapter 4-etc - collect all ideas in the folders [here](https://1drv.ms/f/c/d02df0179143f1bd/IgCFo1RsNQCkQYlu9wsoRxERAU_B0MOZA0RvKDJNn_3afPU?e=dD0DRW)  

3 - A e-pysh simulator:
Regarding the project to mix EEG tracks (see repo brainflow...), look for open source audio track mixers and do a minimalistic viewer where you can combine different charateristics
of an EEG signal (oscillaroty patterns, K-complexes in sleep, spikes in seizures, etc). Different mixing modes (linear, non-linear, multiplicative, convolutional, also with spatial component.
Could be done also for EMG signals.
The goal is to generate simulated signals to test algorithms (online and offline) such as blind cource separation, parafac, ICA, CCA and others.
